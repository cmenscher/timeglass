=========

This is a Google Glass app using PhoneGap 3 and AngularJS.  Right now it just reads and displays accelerometer data, but I'll be using it as a playground so that functionality might change.

Totally inspired by this PhoneGap project:

But unfortunately it was only for PhoneGap 2.9.  I wanted an up-to-date template, and also a basic AngularJS setup.
